** machine
*** [ ] write state machine abstraction

how do we really see what the behaviors are like
could we show them all at once, and see when one starts to deviate?
i see a scene for each scene transition, showing them all at once, or sequentially
*** [ ] tests for state machine guarantees
** tree
*** [ ] write behavior tree abstraction
** goat
*** [ ] write goap abstraction
* trolley

** [ ] unit tests for Trolley.gd
** [ ] writing out an input mapping
should be able to just click yes to get WASD and HJKL for movement
or just make it better - show a keyboard when asking for input?

is there a big keyboard visualization for showing keys we can re-use?
maybe ergodox?
